their edge in the mornin'!\"\n\r\nAnd the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,\r\nAnd we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,\r\nThrew it in the tide for to rock and to roll,\r\nAnd bade it a

dead in the morning.\n\r\nAnd so, to conclude and to finish disputes,\r\nWe obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,\r\nFor we were the lads who would give them hard clouts\r\nAnd bid them look sharp

her away\r\nFrom her mother and sister, though close did they stay\r\nEach one of them suffering from the failures of their day\r\nWith strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us\n\r\nOf the two sisters, I loved the young\r\nWith sensitive instincts, she was the creative one\r\nThe constant scapegoat, she was easily undone\r\nBy the jealousy of others around her\n\r\nFor her parasite sister, I had no respect\r\nBound by her boredom, her pride to protect\r\nCountless visions of the other she\u2019d reflect\r\nAs a crutch for her scenes and her society\n\r\nMyself, for what I did, I cannot be excused\r\nThe changes I was going through can\u2019t even be used\r\nFor the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose\r\nThe could-be dream-lover of my lifetime\n\r\nWith unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip\r\nA magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped\r\nNoticing not that I\u2019d already slipped\r\nTo a sin of love\u2019s false security\n\r\nFrom silhouetted anger to manufactured peace\r\nAnswers of emptiness, voice vacancies\r\nTill the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, \u201cPlease\r\nWhat\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s exactly the matter?\u201d\n\r\nAnd so it did happen like it could have been foreseen\r\nThe timeless explosion of fantasy\u2019s dream\r\nAt the peak of the night, the king and the queen\r\nTumbled all down into pieces\n\r\n\u201cThe tragic figure!\u201d her sister did shout\r\n\u201cLeave her alone, God damn you, get out!\u201d\r\nAnd I in my armor, turning about\r\nAnd nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness\n\r\nBeneath a bare lightbulb the plaster did pound\r\nHer sister and I in a screaming battleground\r\nAnd she in between, the victim of sound\r\nSoon shattered as a child \u2019neath her shadows\n\r\nAll is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight\r\nI gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight\r\nMy mind it was mangled, I ran into the night\r\nLeaving all of love\u2019s ashes behind me\n\r\nThe wind knocks my window, the room it is wet\r\nThe words to say I\u2019m sorry, I haven\u2019t found yet\r\nI think of her often and hope whoever she\u2019s met\r\nWill be fully aware of how precious she is\n\r\nAh, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me\r\n\u201cHow good, how good does it feel to be free?\u201d\r\nAnd I answer them most mysteriously\r\n\u201cAre birds free

France\r\nWho invited me to her house\r\nI went, but she had a friend\r\nWho knocked me out\r\nAnd robbed my boots\r\nAnd I was on the street again\n\r\nWell, I rapped upon a house\r\nWith the U.S.

looking for a cop\n\r\nI ran right outside\r\nAnd I hopped inside a cab\r\nI went out the other door\r\nThis Englishman said, \u201cFab\u201d\r\nAs he saw me leap a hot dog stand\r\nAnd a chariot that stood\r\nParked across from a building\r\nAdvertising brotherhood\r\nI ran right through the front door\r\nLike a hobo sailor does\r\nBut it was just a funeral parlor\r\nAnd the man asked me who I was\n\r\nI repeated that my friends\r\nWere all in jail, with a sigh\r\nHe gave me his card\r\nHe said, \u201cCall me if they die\u201d\r\nI shook his hand and said goodbye\r\nRan out to the

tails\r\nWould let me know if I should go\r\nBack to ship or back to jail\r\nSo I hocked my sailor suit\r\nAnd I got a coin to flip\r\nIt came up tails\r\nIt rhymed with sails\r\nSo I made it back to the ship\n\n\r\nWell, I got back and took\r\nThe parkin\u2019 ticket off the mast\r\nI was ripping it to shreds\r\nWhen this coastguard boat went past\r\nThey asked me my name\r\nAnd I said, \u201cCaptain Kidd\u201d\r\nThey believed me but\r\nThey wanted to know\r\nWhat exactly that I did\r\nI said for the Pope of Eruke\r\nI was employed\r\nThey let me go right away\r\nThey were very paranoid\n\r\nWell, the last I heard of Arab\r\nHe was stuck on a whale\r\nThat was married to the deputy\r\nSheriff of the jail\r\nBut the funniest thing was\r\nWhen I was leavin\u2019 the bay\r\nI saw three ships a-sailin\u2019\r\nThey were all heading my way\r\nI asked the captain what his name was\r\nAnd how come he didn\u2019t drive a truck\r\nHe said his name was Columbus\r\nI just said,

and a-jokin\u2019 about the world outside\n\r\nWith haunted hearts through the heat and cold\r\nWe never thought we could ever get old\r\nWe thought we could sit forever in fun\r\nBut our chances

traveled would ever shatter and split\n\r\nHow many a year has passed and gone\r\nAnd many a gamble has been lost and won\r\nAnd many a road taken by many a friend\r\nAnd each one I\u2019ve never seen

world\u2019s biggest necklace\r\nAs we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold\r\nI was thinkin\u2019 about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless\n\r\nHow she told me that one day we would meet up again\r\nAnd things would be different the next time we wed\r\nIf I only could hang on and just be her friend\r\nI still can\u2019t remember all the best things she said\n\r\nWe came to

on his mind\n\r\nThe wind it was howlin\u2019 and the snow was outrageous\r\nWe chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn\r\nWhen he died I was hopin\u2019 that it wasn\u2019t contagious\r\nBut I made up my mind that I had to go on\n\r\nI broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty\r\nThere was no jewels, no nothin\u2019, I felt I\u2019d been had\r\nWhen I saw that my partner was just bein\u2019 friendly\r\nWhen I took up his offer I must-a been mad\n\r\nI picked up his body and I dragged him inside\r\nThrew him down in the hole and I put back the cover\r\nI said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied\r\nThen I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her\n\r\nShe was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise\r\nBlinded by sleep and in need of a

and sealed in yer head\r\nAnd it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed\r\nAnd no matter how you try you just can't say it\r\nAnd yer scared to yer soul  you just might forget it\r\nAnd yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head\r\nAnd yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead\r\nAnd the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth\r\nAnd his jaws start closin with you underneath\r\nAnd yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind\r\nAnd you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign\r\nAnd you say to yourself just what am I doin'\r\nOn this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'\r\nOn this curve I'm hanging\r\nOn this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking\r\nIn this air I'm inhaling\r\nAm I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard\r\nWhy am I walking, where am I running\r\nWhat am  I saying, what am I knowing\r\nOn this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'\r\nOn this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'\r\nIn the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm writin'\r\nIn the words that I'm thinkin'\r\nIn this ocean of hours I'm  all the time drinkin'\r\nWho am I helping, what am I breaking\r\nWhat am I giving, what am I taking\r\nBut you try with your whole soul best\r\nNever to think these thoughts and never to let\r\nThem kind of thoughts gain ground\r\nOr make yer heart pound\r\nBut then again you know why they're around\r\nJust waiting for a chance to slip and drop down\r\n\"Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping\r\nAnd you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping\r\nAnd you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'\r\nAnd you can't remember for the best of yer thinking\r\nIf that was you in the dream that was screaming\r\nAnd you know that it's something special you're needin'\r\nAnd you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'\r\nAnd no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding\r\nAnd you need something special\r\nYeah, you need something special all right\r\nYou need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track\r\nTo shoot you someplace and shoot you back\r\nYou need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler\r\nThat's been banging and booming and blowing forever\r\nThat knows yer troubles a hundred times over\r\nYou need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race\r\nThat won't laugh at yer looks\r\nYour voice or your face\r\nAnd by any number of bets in the book\r\nWill be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze\r\nYou need something to open up a new door\r\nTo show you something you seen before\r\nBut overlooked a hundred times or more\r\nYou need something to open your eyes\r\nYou need something to make it known\r\nThat it's you and no one else that owns\r\nThat spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting\r\nThat the world ain't got you beat\r\nThat it ain't got you licked\r\nIt can't get you crazy no matter how many\r\nTimes you might get kicked\r\nYou need something special all right\r\nYou need something special to give you hope\r\nBut hope's just a word\r\nThat maybe you said or maybe you heard\r\nOn some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve\n\r\nBut that's what you need man, and you need it bad\r\nAnd yer trouble is you know it too good\r\n\"Cause you look an' you start getting the chills\n\r\n\"Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill\r\nAnd it ain't on Macy's window sill\r\nAnd it

it\r\nRanting and raving and taking yer money\r\nAnd you thinks it's funny\r\nNo you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club\r\nAnd it ain't in the seats of a supper club\r\nAnd sure as hell you're bound to tell\r\nThat no matter how hard you rub\r\nYou just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub\r\nNo, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you\r\nAnd it ain't in the

neither can Santa Claus\r\nAnd it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes\r\nAnd it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons\r\nAnd it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices\r\nThat come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'\r\nSayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin\r\nLook at my skin shine, look at my skin glow\r\nLook at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry\r\nWhen you can't even sense if they got any insides\r\nThese people so pretty in their ribbons and bows\r\nNo you'll not now or no other day\r\nFind it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache\u00a5\r\nAnd inside it the people made of molasses\r\nThat every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses\r\nAnd it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies\r\nWho'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny\r\nWho breathe and burp and bend and crack\r\nAnd before you can count from one to ten\r\nDo it all over again but this time behind yer back\r\nMy friend\r\nThe ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl\r\nAnd play games with each other in their sand-box world\r\nAnd you can't find it either in the no-talent fools\r\nThat run around gallant\r\nAnd make all rules for the ones that got talent\r\nAnd it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do\r\nAnd think they're foolin' you\r\nThe ones who jump on the wagon\r\nJust for a while 'cause they know it's in style\r\nTo get their kicks, get out of it quick\r\nAnd make all kinds of money and chicks\r\nAnd you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat\r\nSayin', \"Christ do I gotta be like that\r\nAin't there no one here that knows where I'm at\r\nAin't there no one here that knows how I feel\r\nGood God Almighty\r\nTHAT STUFF AIN'T REAL\"\n\r\nNo but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race\r\nYou can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face\r\nYou gotta look some other place\r\nAnd where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'\r\nWhere do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'\r\nWhere do you look for this oil well gushin'\r\nWhere do you look for this candle that's glowin'\r\nWhere do you look for this hope that you know is there\r\nAnd out there somewhere\r\nAnd your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads\r\nYour eyes can only look through two kinds of windows\r\nYour nose can only smell two kinds of hallways\r\nYou can touch and twist\r\nAnd turn two kinds of doorknobs\r\nYou can either go to the church of your choice\r\nOr you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital\r\nYou'll find God in the church of your choice\r\nYou'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital\n\r\nAnd though it's only my opinion\r\nI may be right or wrong\r\nYou'll find them both\r\nIn the Grand Canyon\r\nAt sundown",

home\r\nLike a complete unknown\r\nLike a rolling stone?\n\r\nYou\u2019ve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely\r\nBut you know you only used to get juiced in it\r\nAnd nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street\r\nAnd now you find out you\u2019re gonna have to get used to it\r\nYou said you\u2019d never compromise\r\nWith the mystery tramp, but now you realize\r\nHe\u2019s not selling any alibis\r\nAs you stare into the vacuum of his eyes\r\nAnd ask him do you want to make a deal?\n\r\nHow does it feel\r\nHow does it feel\r\nTo be on your own\r\nWith no direction home\r\nLike a complete unknown\r\nLike a rolling stone?\n\r\nYou never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns\r\nWhen they all come down and did tricks for you\r\nYou never understood that it ain\u2019t no good\r\nYou shouldn\u2019t let other people get your kicks for you\r\nYou used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat\r\nWho carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat\r\nAin\u2019t it hard when you discover that\r\nHe really wasn\u2019t where it\u2019s at\r\nAfter he took from you everything he could steal\n\r\nHow does it

drinkin\u2019, thinkin\u2019 that they got it made\r\nExchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things\r\nBut you\u2019d better lift your diamond ring, you\u2019d better pawn it babe\r\nYou used to be so amused\r\nAt Napoleon in rags and the language that he used\r\nGo to him now, he calls you, you can\u2019t refuse\r\nWhen you got nothing, you got nothing to lose\r\nYou\u2019re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal\n\r\nHow does it feel\r\nHow does it feel\r\nTo be on your own\r\nWith no direction home\r\nLike a complete unknown\r\nLike a rolling stone?", "albums": ["The Bootleg

over, the boys were all plannin\u2019 for a fall\r\nThe cabaret was quiet except for the drillin\u2019 in the wall\r\nThe curfew had been lifted and the gamblin\u2019 wheel shut down\r\nAnyone with any sense had already left town\r\nHe was standin\u2019 in the doorway lookin\u2019 like the Jack of Hearts\n\r\nHe moved across the mirrored room, \u201cSet it up for everyone,\u201d he said\r\nThen everyone commenced to do what they were doin\u2019 before he turned their heads\r\nThen he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin\r\n\u201cCould you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?\u201d\r\nThen he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts\n\r\nBackstage the girls were playin\u2019 five-card stud by the stairs\r\nLily had two queens, she was hopin\u2019 for a third to match her pair\r\nOutside the streets were fillin\u2019 up, the window was open wide\r\nA gentle breeze was blowin\u2019, you could feel it from inside\r\nLily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts\n\r\nBig Jim was no one\u2019s fool, he owned the town\u2019s only diamond mine\r\nHe made his usual entrance lookin\u2019 so dandy and so fine\r\nWith his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place\r\nHe took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste\r\nBut his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts\n\r\nRosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town\r\nShe slipped in through the side door lookin\u2019 like a queen without a crown\r\nShe fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear\r\n\u201cSorry, darlin\u2019, that I\u2019m late,\u201d but he didn\u2019t seem to hear\r\nHe was starin\u2019 into space over at the Jack of Hearts\n\r\n\u201cI know I\u2019ve seen that face before,\u201d Big Jim was thinkin\u2019 to himself\r\n\u201cMaybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody\u2019s shelf\u201d\r\nBut then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the houselights did dim\r\nAnd in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him\r\nStarin\u2019 at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts\n\r\nLily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child\r\nShe did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she    smiled\r\nShe\u2019d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs\r\nWith men in every walk of life which took her everywhere\r\nBut she\u2019d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts\n\r\nThe hangin\u2019 judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined\r\nThe drillin\u2019 in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind\r\nIt was known all around that Lily had Jim\u2019s ring\r\nAnd nothing would ever come between Lily and the king\r\nNo, nothin\u2019 ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts\n\r\nRosemary started drinkin\u2019 hard and seein\u2019 her reflection in the knife\r\nShe was tired of the attention, tired of playin\u2019 the role of Big Jim\u2019s wife\r\nShe had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide\r\nWas lookin\u2019 to do just one good deed before she died\r\nShe was gazin\u2019 to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts\n\r\nLily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away\r\n\u201cHas your luck run out?\u201d she laughed at him, \u201cWell, I guess you must\r\nhave known it would someday\r\nBe careful not to touch the wall, there\u2019s a brand-new coat of paint\r\nI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re still alive, you\u2019re lookin\u2019 like a saint\u201d\r\nDown the hallway footsteps were comin\u2019 for the Jack of Hearts\n\r\nThe backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something funny going on,\u201d he said, \u201cI can just feel it in the air\u201d\r\nHe went to get the hangin\u2019 judge, but the hangin\u2019 judge was drunk\r\nAs the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk\r\nThere was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts\n\r\nLily\u2019s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch\r\nShe forgot all about the man she couldn\u2019t stand who hounded her so much\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed you so,\u201d she said to him, and he felt she was sincere\r\nBut just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear\r\nJust another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts\n\r\nNo one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick\r\nThe door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked\r\nAnd Big Jim was standin\u2019 there, ya couldn\u2019t say surprised\r\nRosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes\r\nShe was with Big Jim but she was leanin\u2019 to the Jack of Hearts\n\r\nTwo doors down the boys finally made it through the wall\r\nAnd cleaned out the bank safe, it\u2019s said that they got off with quite a haul\r\nIn the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground\r\nFor one more member who had business back in town\r\nBut they couldn\u2019t go no further without the Jack of Hearts\n\r\nThe next day was hangin\u2019 day, the sky was overcast and black\r\nBig Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back\r\nAnd Rosemary on the gallows, she didn\u2019t even blink\r\nThe hangin\u2019 judge was sober, he hadn\u2019t had a drink\r\nThe only person on the scene missin\u2019 was the Jack of Hearts\n\r\nThe cabaret was empty now, a sign said, \u201cClosed for repair\u201d\r\nLily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair\r\nShe was thinkin\u2019 \u2019bout her father, who she very rarely saw\r\nThinkin\u2019 \u2019bout Rosemary and thinkin\u2019 about the law\r\nBut most of all she was thinkin\u2019 \u2019bout the Jack of Hearts", "albums": ["Blood On The Tracks"], "url":

and he gambled all his life\r\nHe had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife\r\nAnd it\u2019s ride, Willie, ride\r\nRoll, Willie, roll\r\nWherever you are a-gamblin\u2019 now, nobody really knows\n\r\nHe gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards\r\nWherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards\r\nHe had the reputation as the gamblin\u2019est man around\r\nWives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town\r\nAnd it\u2019s ride, Willie, ride\r\nRoll, Willie, roll\r\nWherever you are a-gamblin\u2019 now, nobody really knows\n\r\nSailin\u2019 down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans\r\nThey\u2019re still talkin\u2019 about their card game on that Jackson River Queen\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to win some money,\u201d Gamblin\u2019 Willie says\r\nWhen the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his\r\nAnd it\u2019s ride, Willie, ride\r\nRoll, Willie, roll\r\nWherever you are a-gamblin\u2019 now, nobody really knows\n\r\nUp in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek\r\nThere was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week\r\nNine hundred miners had laid their money down\r\nWhen Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town\r\nAnd it\u2019s ride, Willie, ride\r\nRoll, Willie, roll\r\nWherever you are a-gamblin\u2019 now, nobody really knows\n\r\nBut Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true\r\nHe supported all his children and all their mothers too\r\nHe wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore\r\nHe spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor\r\nAnd it\u2019s ride, Willie, ride\r\nRoll, Willie, roll\r\nWherever you are a-gamblin\u2019 now, nobody really knows\n\r\nWhen you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew\r\nWhether he was bluffin\u2019 or whether he was true\r\nHe won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair\r\nThe man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn\u2019t even have a pair\r\nAnd it\u2019s ride, Willie, ride\r\nRoll, Willie, roll\r\nWherever you are a-gamblin\u2019 now, nobody really knows\n\r\nIt was late one evenin\u2019 during a poker game\r\nA man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame\r\nHe shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate\r\nWhen Willie\u2019s cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights\r\nAnd it\u2019s ride, Willie, ride\r\nRoll, Willie, roll\r\nWherever you are a-gamblin\u2019 now, nobody really knows\n\r\nSo all you rovin\u2019 gamblers, wherever you might be\r\nThe moral of the story is very plain to see\r\nMake your money while you can, before you have to stop\r\nFor when you pull that dead man\u2019s hand, your gamblin\u2019 days are up\r\nAnd it\u2019s ride, Willie, ride\r\nRoll, Willie, roll\r\nWherever you are

something inside of him died\r\nShe had to sell everything she owned\r\nAnd froze up inside\r\nAnd when finally the bottom fell out\r\nI became withdrawn\r\nThe only thing I knew how to do\r\nWas to

were sharp and clear\r\nMoving through the shadows\r\nThe promised hour was near\n\r\nLights were holding steady\r\nGliding over the foam\r\nAll the lords and ladies\r\nHeading for their eternal home\n\r\nThe chandeliers were swaying\r\nFrom the balustrades above\r\nThe orchestra was playing\r\nSongs of faded love\n\r\nThe watchman he lay dreaming\r\nAs the ballroom dancers twirled\r\nHe

bosom\r\nAnd broke it with a snap\r\nThe closest woman to him\r\nHe fell into her lap\n\r\nHe heard a loud commotion\r\nSomething sounded wrong\r\nHis inner spirit was saying\r\nThat he couldn\u2019t stand here long\n\r\nHe staggered to the quarterdeck\r\nNo time now to sleep \r\nWater on the quarterdeck\r\nAlready three foot deep\n\r\nSmokestack leaning sideways\r\nHeavy feet began to pound\r\nHe walked into the whirlwind\r\nSky spinning all around\n\r\nThe ship was going under\r\nThe universe opened wide\r\nThe roll was called up yonder\r\nThe angels turned aside\n\r\nLights down in the hallway\r\nFlickering dim and dull\r\nDead bodies already floating\r\nIn the double bottomed hull\n\r\nThe engines then exploded\r\nPropellers they failed to start\r\nThe boilers overloaded\r\nThe ships bow split apart\n\r\nPassengers were flying\r\nBackward, forward, far and fast\r\nThey mumbled, fumbled, tumbled\r\nEach one more weary than the last\n\r\nThe veil was torn asunder\r\n\u2018Tween the hours of twelve and one\r\nNo change, no sudden wonder\r\nCould undo what had been done\n\r\nThe watchman lay there dreaming\r\nAt fourty-five degrees\r\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\r\nDropping to her knees\n\r\nWellington, he was sleeping\r\nHis bed began to slide\r\nHis valiant heart was beating\r\nHe pushed the tables aside\n\r\nGlass of shattered crystal\r\nLay scattered \u2018round about\r\nHe strapped on both his pistols  \r\nHow long could he hold out?\n\r\nHis men and his companions\r\nWere nowhere to be seen\r\nIn silence there he waited for\r\nTime and space to intervene\n\r\nThe passageway was narrow\r\nThere was blackness in the air\r\nHe saw every kind of sorrow\r\nHeard voices everywhere\n\r\nAlarm bells were ringing\r\nTo hold back the swelling tide\r\nFriends and lovers clinging\r\nTo each other side by side\n\r\nMothers and their daughters\r\nDescending down the stairs\r\nJumped into the icy waters\r\nLove and pity sent their prayers\n\r\nThe rich man, Mr. Astor\r\nKissed his darling wife\r\nHe had no way of knowing\r\nBe the last trip of his life\n\r\nCalvin, Blake and Wilson \r\nGambled in the dark\r\nNot one of them would ever live to\r\nTell the tale of disembark\n\r\nBrother rose up against brother\r\nIn every circumstance\r\nThey fought and slaughtered each other\r\nIn a deadly dance\n\r\nThey lowered down the lifeboats\r\nFrom the sinking wreck\r\nThere were traitors, there were turncoats\r\nBroken backs and broken necks\n\r\nThe bishop left his cabin\r\nTo help all those in need\r\nTurned his eyes up to the heavens\r\nSaid, \u201cThe poor are yours to feed.\u201d\n\r\nDavey the brothel keeper\r\nCame out, dismissed his girls\r\nSaw the water getting deeper\r\nSaw the changing of his world\n\r\nJim Dandy smiled\r\nHe'd never learned to swim\r\nSaw the little crippled child\r\nAnd he gave his seat to him\n\r\nHe saw the starlight shining\r\nStreaming from the East\r\nDeath was on the rampage\r\nBut his heart was now at peace\n\r\nThey battened down the hatches\r\nBut the hatches wouldn\u2019t hold\r\nThey drowned upon the staircase\r\nOf brass and polished gold\n\r\nLeo said to Cleo,\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going mad.\u201d\r\nBut he'd lost his mind already\r\nWhatever mind he had\n\r\nHe tried to block the doorway\r\nTo save all those from harm\r\nBlood from an open wound\r\nPouring down his arm\n\r\nPetals fell from flowers\r\n\u2018Til all of them were gone\r\nIn the long and dreadful hours\r\nThe wizard\u2019s curse played on\n\r\nThe host was pouring brandy\r\nHe was going down slow\r\nHe stayed right \u2018til the end\r\nHe was the last to go\n\r\nThere were many, many others\r\nNameless here for evermore\r\nThey'd never sailed the ocean\r\nOr left their homes before\n\r\nThe watchman, he lay dreaming\r\nThe damage had been done\r\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\r\nAnd he tried to tell someone\n\r\nThe captain, barely breathing\r\nKneeling at the wheel\r\nAbove him and beneath him\r\nFifty thousand tons of steel\n\r\nHe looked over at his compass\r\nAnd he gazed into its face\r\nNeedle pointing downward\r\nHe knew he lost the race\n\r\nIn the dark illumination\r\nHe remembered bygone years\r\nHe read the Book of Revelation\r\nAnd he filled his cup with tears\n\r\nWhen the Reaper\u2019s task had ended\r\nSixteen hundred had gone to rest\r\nThe good, the bad, the rich, the poor\r\nThe loveliest and the best\n\r\nThey waited at the landing\r\nAnd they tried to understand\r\nBut there is no understanding\r\nOn the judgment of God\u2019s hand\n\r\nNews came over the wires\r\nAnd struck with deadly force\r\nLove had lost its fires\r\nAll things had run their course\n\r\nThe watchman he lay dreaming\r\nOf all

made\r\nWhile the mission bells did toll\r\nHe just stood there staring\r\nAt that big house as bright as any sun\r\nWith four and twenty windows\r\nAnd a woman\u2019s face in ev\u2019ry one\n\r\nWell, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee\r\nWith a soulful, bounding leap\r\nAnd, foaming at the mouth\r\nHe began to make his midnight creep\r\nFor sixteen nights and days he raved\r\nBut on the seventeenth he burst\r\nInto the arms of Judas Priest\r\nWhich is where he died of thirst\n\r\nNo one tried to say a thing\r\nWhen they took him out in jest\r\nExcept, of course, the little neighbor

the story\r\nThe moral of this song\r\nIs simply that one should never be\r\nWhere one does not belong\r\nSo when you see your neighbor carryin\u2019 somethin\u2019\r\nHelp him with his load\r\nAnd

well\r\nThe color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till\n\r\nSome men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up\r\nThey said they had a reason, but I can\u2019t remember what\r\nThey tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat\r\nThere were screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds\r\n     out on the street\n\r\nThen they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain\r\nAnd they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain\r\nThe reason that they killed him there, and I\u2019m sure it ain\u2019t no lie\r\nWas just for the fun of killin\u2019 him and to watch him slowly die\n\r\nAnd then to stop the United States of yelling for a trial\r\nTwo brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till\r\nBut on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this\r\n     awful crime\r\nAnd so this trial was a mockery, but nobody seemed to mind\n\r\nI saw the morning papers but I could not bear to see\r\nThe smiling brothers walkin\u2019 down the courthouse stairs\r\nFor the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free\r\nWhile Emmett\u2019s body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea\n\r\nIf you can\u2019t speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that\u2019s so unjust\r\nYour eyes are filled with dead men\u2019s dirt, your mind is filled with dust\r\nYour arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood   \r\n     it must refuse to flow\r\nFor you let this human race fall down so God-awful low!\n\r\nThis song is just a reminder to remind your fellow man\r\nThat this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan\r\nBut if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we could give\r\nWe could make this great land

meet the lord of death.\r\nIt was I who brought your soul to life.\u201d\r\nAnd she raised her robe and she drew out a knife\n\r\nHis face was hard and caked with sweat\r\nHis arms ached and his hands

long gone, I guess it must be up to me\n\r\nIf I\u2019d thought about it I never would\u2019ve done it, I guess I would\u2019ve let it slide\r\nIf I\u2019d lived my life by what others were thinkin\u2019, the heart inside me would\u2019ve died\r\nI was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity\r\nSomeone had to reach for the risin\u2019 star, I guess it was up to me\n\r\nOh, the Union Central is pullin\u2019 out and the orchids are in bloom\r\nI\u2019ve only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume\r\nIn fourteen months I\u2019ve only smiled

about convinced myself that nothin\u2019 had changed that much\r\nThe old Rounder in the iron mask slipped me the master key\r\nSomebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me\n\r\nWell, I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers\u2019 club\r\nI would\u2019ve followed you in the door but I didn\u2019t have a ticket stub\r\nSo I waited all night \u2019til the break of day, hopin\u2019 one of us could get free\r\nWhen the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me\n\r\nOh, the only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk\r\nWas to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work\r\nWas I a fool or not to try to protect your identity?\r\nYou looked a little burned out, my friend, I thought it might be up to me\n\r\nWell, I met somebody face to face and I had to remove my hat\r\nShe\u2019s everything I need and love but I can\u2019t be swayed by that\r\nIt frightens me, the awful truth of how sweet life can be\r\nBut she ain\u2019t a-gonna make me move, I guess it must be up to me\n\r\nWe heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex\r\nIt didn\u2019t amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects\r\nWhen you bite off more than you can chew you pay the penalty\r\nSomebody\u2019s got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me\n\r\nWell, Dupree came in pimpin\u2019 tonight to the Thunderbird Caf\u00e9\r\nCrystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way\r\nWell, I just can\u2019t rest without you, love, I need your company\r\nBut you ain\u2019t a-gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me\n\r\nThere\u2019s a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle\r\nShe\u2019s the one you been wond\u2019rin\u2019 about, but there\u2019s really nothin\u2019 much to tell\r\nWe both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history\r\nSomebody\u2019s got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me\n\r\nSo go on, boys, and play your hands, life is a pantomime\r\nThe ringleaders from the county seat say you don\u2019t have all that much time\r\nAnd the girl with me behind the shades, she ain\u2019t my property\r\nOne of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me\n\r\nAnd if we never meet again, baby, remember me\r\nHow my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody\r\nAnd the harmonica around my neck, I blew it

trial\r\nVoices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while\r\nBut Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues\r\nYou can tell by the way she smiles\r\nSee the primitive wallflower freeze\r\nWhen

of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel\n\r\nThe peddler now speaks to the countess who\u2019s pretending to care for him\r\nSayin\u2019, \u201cName me someone that\u2019s not a parasite and I\u2019ll go out and say a prayer for him\u201d\r\nBut like Louise always says\r\n\u201cYa can\u2019t look at much, can ya man?\u201d\r\nAs she, herself, prepares for him\r\nAnd Madonna, she still has not showed\r\nWe see this empty cage now corrode\r\nWhere her cape of the stage once had flowed\r\nThe fiddler, he now steps to the road\r\nHe writes ev\u2019rything\u2019s been returned which was owed\r\nOn the back of the fish truck that loads\r\nWhile my conscience explodes\r\nThe harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain\r\nAnd these visions of Johanna are now all that remain",
