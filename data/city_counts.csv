I’m a poet, and I know it\r\nHope I don’t blow it\n\r\nI’m gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange\r\nSo I look like a walking mountain range\r\nAnd I’m gonna ride into Omaha on a horse\r\nOut to the country club and the golf course\r\nCarry The New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds\n\r\nNow you’re probably wondering by now\r\nJust what this song is all about\r\nWhat’s probably got you baffled more\r\nIs what this thing here is for\r\nIt’s nothing\r\nIt’s something I learned over in England', 'Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when\r\nOpened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion\r\nAlways on the outside of whatever side there was\r\nWhen they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered,\r\n“just because”\n\r\nLarry was the oldest, Joey was next to last\r\nThey called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast”\r\nSome say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too\r\nIt always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue\n\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nKing of the streets, child of clay\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?\n\r\nThere was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that\r\nNo one ever knew for sure where they were really at\r\nWhen they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof\r\nHe went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin’ he was bulletproof\n\r\nThe war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets\r\nJoey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats\r\nTill they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners\r\nThey stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs\n\r\nThe hostages were tremblin’ when they heard a man exclaim\r\n“Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame”\r\nBut Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, “We’re not those kind of men\r\nIt’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again”\n\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nKing of the streets, child of clay\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?\n\r\nThe police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith\r\nThey got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with\r\n“What time is it?” said the judge to Joey when they met\r\n“Five to ten,” said Joey. The judge says, “That’s exactly what you get”\n\r\nHe did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich\r\nThey threw him in the hole one time for tryin’ to stop a strike\r\nHis closest friends were black men ’cause they seemed to understand\r\nWhat it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand\n\r\nWhen they let him out in ’71 he’d lost a little weight\r\nBut he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great\r\nHe tried to find the way back into the life he left behind\r\nTo the boss he said, “I have returned and now I want what’s mine”\n\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nKing of the streets, child of clay\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nWhy did they have to come and blow you away?\n\r\nIt was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun\r\n“I’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one”\r\nYet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe\r\nEmptied out the register, said, “Tell ’em it was Crazy Joe”\n\r\nOne day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York\r\nHe could see it comin’ through the door as he lifted up his fork\r\nHe pushed the table over to protect his family\r\nThen he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy\n\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nKing of the streets, child of clay\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?\n\r\nSister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep\r\nI heard his best friend Frankie say, “He ain’t dead, he’s just asleep”\r\nThen I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave\r\nI guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save\n\r\nThe sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned\r\nThey said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born\r\nAnd someday if God’s in heaven overlookin’ His preserve\r\nI know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve\n\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nKing of the streets, child of clay\r\nJoey, Joey\r\nWhat made them want to come and blow you away?', 'When you’re lost in the rain in Juarez\r\nAnd it’s Eastertime too\r\nAnd your gravity fails\r\nAnd negativity don’t pull you through\r\nDon’t put on any airs\r\nWhen you’re down on Rue Morgue Avenue\r\nThey got some hungry women there\r\nAnd they really make a mess outta you\n\r\nNow if you see Saint Annie\r\nPlease tell her thanks a lot\r\nI cannot move\r\nMy fingers are all in a knot\r\nI don’t have the strength\r\nTo get up and take another shot\r\nAnd my best friend, my doctor\r\nWon’t even say what it is I’ve got\n\r\nSweet Melinda\r\nThe peasants call her the goddess of

moon\n\r\nUp on Housing Project Hill\r\nIt’s either fortune or fame\r\nYou must pick up one or the other\r\nThough neither of them are to be what they claim\r\nIf you’re lookin’ to get silly\r\nYou better go back to from where you came\r\nBecause the cops don’t need you\r\nAnd man they expect the same\n\r\nNow all the authorities\r\nThey just stand around and boast\r\nHow they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms\r\nInto leaving his post\r\nAnd picking up Angel who\r\nJust arrived here from the coast\r\nWho looked so fine at first\r\nBut left looking just like a ghost\n\r\nI started out on burgundy\r\nBut soon hit the harder stuff\r\nEverybody said they’d stand behind me\r\nWhen the game got rough\r\nBut the joke was on me\r\nThere was nobody even there to call my bluff\r\nI’m going back to New York City\r\nI do believe I’ve had enough', 'Ramblin’ outa the wild West\r\nLeavin’ the towns I love the best\r\nThought I’d seen some ups and downs\r\n’Til I come into New York

right to the bone\r\nI froze right to the bone\r\nNew York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years\r\nI didn’t feel so cold then\n\r\nI swung onto my old guitar\r\nGrabbed hold of a subway car\r\nAnd after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride\r\nI landed up on the downtown side\r\nGreenwich Village\n\r\nI walked down there and ended up\r\nIn one of them coffee-houses on the block\r\nGot on the stage to sing and play\r\nMan there said, “Come back some other day\r\nYou sound like a hillbilly\r\nWe want folk singers here”\n\r\nWell, I got a harmonica job, begun to play\r\nBlowin’ my lungs out for a dollar a day\r\nI blowed inside out and upside down\r\nThe man there said he loved m’ sound\r\nHe was ravin’ about how he loved m’ sound\r\nDollar a day’s worth\n\r\nAnd after weeks and weeks of hangin’ around\r\nI finally got a job in New York town\r\nIn a bigger place, bigger money too\r\nEven joined the union and paid m’ dues\n\r\nNow, a very great man once said\r\nThat some people rob you with a fountain pen\r\nIt didn’t take too long to find out\r\nJust what he was talkin’ about\r\nA lot of people don’t have much food on their table\r\nBut they got a lot of forks ’n’ knives\r\nAnd they gotta cut somethin’\n\r\nSo one mornin’ when the sun was warm\r\nI rambled out of New York town\r\nPulled my cap down over my eyes\r\nAnd headed out for the western skies\r\nSo long, New York\r\nHowdy, East Orange', 'As I was walking that ribbon of highway\r\nI saw above me that endless skyway\r\nI saw below me that golden valley\r\nThis land was made

we could\r\nAbandoned it out West\r\nSplit up on a dark sad night\r\nBoth agreeing it was best\r\nShe turned around to look at me\r\nAs I was walkin’ away\r\nI heard her say over my shoulder\r\n“We’ll meet again someday on the avenue”\r\nTangled up in blue\n\r\nI had a job in the great north woods\r\nWorking as a cook for a spell\r\nBut I never did like it all that much\r\nAnd one day the ax just fell\r\nSo I drifted down to New Orleans\r\nWhere I happened to be employed\r\nWorkin’ for a while on a fishin’ boat\r\nRight outside of Delacroix\r\nBut all the while I was alone\r\nThe past was close behind\r\nI seen a lot of women\r\nBut she never escaped my mind, and I just grew\r\nTangled up in blue\n\r\nShe was workin’ in a topless place\r\nAnd I stopped in for a beer\r\nI just kept lookin’ at the side of her face\r\nIn the spotlight so clear\r\nAnd later on as the crowd thinned out\r\nI’s just about to do the same\r\nShe was standing there in back of my chair\r\nSaid to me, “Don’t I know your name?”\r\nI muttered somethin’ underneath my breath\r\nShe studied the lines on my face\r\nI must admit I felt a little uneasy\r\nWhen she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe\r\nTangled up in blue\n\r\nShe lit a burner on the stove\r\nAnd offered me a pipe\r\n“I thought you’d never say hello,” she said\r\n“You look like the silent type”\r\nThen she opened up a book of poems\r\nAnd handed it to me\r\nWritten by an Italian poet\r\nFrom the thirteenth century\r\nAnd every one of them words rang true\r\nAnd glowed like burnin’ coal\r\nPourin’ off of every page\r\nLike it was written in my soul from me to you\r\nTangled up in blue\n\r\nI lived with them on Montague Street\r\nIn a basement down the stairs\r\nThere was music in the cafés at night\r\nAnd revolution in the air\r\nThen he started into dealing with slaves\r\nAnd something inside of him died\r\nShe had to sell everything she owned\r\nAnd froze up inside\r\nAnd when finally the bottom fell out\r\nI became withdrawn\r\nThe only thing I knew how to do\r\nWas to keep on keepin’ on like a bird that flew\r\nTangled up in blue\n\r\nSo now I’m goin’ back again\r\nI got to get to her somehow\r\nAll the
