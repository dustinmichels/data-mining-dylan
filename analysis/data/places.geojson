Bradley were just out prowlin\u2019 around\r\nHe said, \u201cI saw two men runnin\u2019 out, they looked like middleweights\r\nThey jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates\u201d\r\nAnd Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head\r\nCop said, \u201cWait a minute, boys, this one\u2019s not dead\u201d\r\nSo they took him to the infirmary\r\nAnd though this man could hardly see\r\nThey told him that he could identify the guilty men\n\r\nFour in the mornin\u2019 and they haul Rubin in\r\nTake him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs\r\nThe wounded man looks up through his one dyin\u2019 eye\r\nSays, \u201cWha\u2019d you bring him in here for? He ain\u2019t the guy!\u201d\r\nYes, here\u2019s the story of the Hurricane\r\nThe man the authorities came to blame\r\nFor somethin\u2019 that he never done\r\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\r\nThe champion of the world\n\r\nFour months later, the ghettos are in flame\r\nRubin\u2019s in South America, fightin\u2019 for his name\r\nWhile Arthur Dexter Bradley\u2019s still in the robbery game\r\nAnd the cops are puttin\u2019 the screws to him, lookin\u2019 for somebody to blame\r\n\u201cRemember that murder that happened in a bar?\u201d\r\n\u201cRemember you said you saw the getaway car?\u201d\r\n\u201cYou think you\u2019d like to play ball with the law?\u201d\r\n\u201cThink it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin\u2019 that night?\u201d\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that you are white\u201d\n\r\nArthur Dexter Bradley said, \u201cI\u2019m really not sure\u201d\r\nCops said, \u201cA poor boy like you could use a break\r\nWe got you for the motel job and we\u2019re talkin\u2019 to your friend Bello\r\nNow you don\u2019t wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow\r\nYou\u2019ll be doin\u2019 society a favor\r\nThat sonofabitch is brave and gettin\u2019 braver\r\nWe want to put his ass in stir\r\nWe want to pin this triple murder on him\r\nHe ain\u2019t no Gentleman Jim\u201d\n\r\nRubin could take a man out with just one punch\r\nBut he never did like to talk about it all that much\r\nIt\u2019s my work, he\u2019d say, and I do it for pay\r\nAnd when it\u2019s over I\u2019d just as soon go on my way\r\nUp to some paradise\r\nWhere the trout streams flow and the air is nice\r\nAnd ride a horse along a trail\r\nBut then they took him to the jailhouse\r\nWhere they try to turn a man into a mouse\n\r\nAll of Rubin\u2019s cards were marked in advance\r\nThe trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance\r\nThe judge made Rubin\u2019s witnesses drunkards from the slums\r\nTo the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum\r\nAnd to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger\r\nNo one doubted that he pulled the trigger\r\nAnd though they could not produce the gun\r\nThe D.A. said he was the one who did the deed\r\nAnd the all-white jury agreed\n\r\nRubin Carter was falsely tried\r\nThe crime was murder \u201cone,\u201d guess who testified?\r\nBello and Bradley and they both baldly lied\r\nAnd the newspapers, they all went along for the ride\r\nHow can the life of such a man\r\nBe in the palm of some fool\u2019s hand?\r\nTo see him obviously framed\r\nCouldn\u2019t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land\r\nWhere justice is a game\n\r\nNow all the criminals in their coats and their ties\r\nAre free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise\r\nWhile Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell\r\nAn innocent man in a living hell\r\nThat\u2019s the story of the Hurricane\r\nBut it won\u2019t be over till they clear his name\r\nAnd give him back the time he\u2019s done\r\nPut in a prison
